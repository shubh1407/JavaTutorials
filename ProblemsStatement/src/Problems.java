/*
 * Given a ArrayList of N elements and a integer Q defining the type of query
 * (which will be either 1 or 2) :
	Q = 1 includes two integers p and r. Which means insert the value r at index p 
	in the ArrayList and print the whole updated ArrayList.
	Q = 2 includes one integer p. In this query print the index at which the value p is last found 
	in the ArrayList. If the value p is not found in the ArrayList then print "-1".
